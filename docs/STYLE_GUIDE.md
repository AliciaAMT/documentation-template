## Introduction

The Mandalan Tales Style Guide outlines the conventions and best practices to be followed by contributors to ensure a consistent and well-maintained project.

## Code Style

### Indentation

- Use four spaces for indentation.
- Avoid using tabs for indentation.

### Variable Naming

- Follow camelCase for variable names (e.g., `playerScore`).
- Use meaningful and descriptive names.

### Function Naming

- Use camelCase for function names (e.g., `calculateScore`).
- Use verbs to describe actions performed by functions.

### Comments

- Use comments sparingly and focus on explaining complex logic or providing context.
- Ensure comments are concise and add value to the understanding of the code.

## Documentation

### README

- Keep the README up-to-date with project information, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant details.
- Include badges for build status, code coverage, etc., if applicable.

### Code Comments

- Document complex algorithms or sections of code to enhance readability.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that only repeat what the code is doing.

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Color Palette

- Define a consistent color palette to be used across the application.

- Ensure readability in all interfaces.

### Layout
