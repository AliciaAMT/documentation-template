# Developer Notes

## 1/1/2024

Coming back after a long time. I didn't get far last time so i am starting over to use the newest Ionic. 

For now I am just establishing a template and structure. This project will require LOTS of documentation. I'm not even starting on the code until docs are done and prototyping.
